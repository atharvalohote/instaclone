# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `instagram-clone`
   - **Description**: `A full-stack Instagram clone built with React Native and Node.js`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/instagram-clone.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository URL
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. Check that the `.env` file is NOT visible (it should be ignored)

## Step 4: Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to showcase your project:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings"
3. Scroll down to "Pages"
4. Select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/docs" folder
6. Click "Save"
